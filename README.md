A little repo to serve a few different purposes:
1: To help keep track of, and then refactor, my attempts at the JavaScript algorithm exercises in FreeCodeCamp
2: To help me practice using Git via the command line
3: To get me pushing things to Github and figuring out how to fix it all when it goes wrong!
