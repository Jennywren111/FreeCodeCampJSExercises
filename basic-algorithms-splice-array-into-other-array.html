  <h1>Slice and Splice - insert one array into another at specified index.</h1>
  <p>
    You are given two arrays and an index.
    Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.
    Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.
    Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.
  </p>
  
  <script>
    function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
      // split arr2 into two at index 'n'. 
      // store each half in a different var
      // add the first bit, then arr1 then second bit to a new array. 
      // Ooh actually, can we use splice to do this? .splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, thingsToAdd);
      // Hmm, okay so we need to copy arr2 in order to pass the test... My code feels a bit hacked. Need to review. Also, .flat() will not work if there are nested arrays being passed in, would need to specify depth level.
      let spliced = [...arr2];
      spliced.splice(n, 0, arr1);
      return spliced.flat();
    }
    frankenSplice([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], 1);
